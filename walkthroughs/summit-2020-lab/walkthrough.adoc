= Red Hat Summit 2020 RHMI Lab

Welcome to the Red Hat Summit 2020 Red Hat Managed Integration Lab!

Red Hat Managed Integration (RHMI) delivers cloud-based agile integration services hosted on OpenShift Dedicated (OSD). Using RHMI we can create consistent, immediately available, managed environments so that development teams can more easily build enterprise applications on OpenShift.
These environments accelerate engagement timelines, reduce operational risk and cost, and address the needs of the evolving enterprise integration market.

In this lab you’re tasked with building out a real-time IoT traffic and parking meter management solution for the city of Los Angeles - don't worry we'll be helping you along the way!

The tasks you'll perform include:

{blank}

* Data ingestion of real time traffic and parking meter data from AMQ Streams into a Postgres Database using Red Hat Fuse Online
* Definition of an OpenAPI compatible API Spec using Red Hat API Designer
* Deployment of a ready-made API using your choice of Runtime technologies - Fuse or Node.js
* Protection of the API using 3scale API Management
* Visualisation of the data from the API via a front end web app based on React.js and Patternfly.js

{blank}

To get you started, you will be provided with the following infrastructure:

* An AMQ Streams instance with 2 topics - {streams-junction-topic-name} and {streams-meter-topic-name}. These topics will be connected to a live stream of IoT data which needs to be ingested
* A Postgres server with two databases:
- A pre-populated Lookup database containing reference data which maps incoming Ids for traffic junctions and parking meters to their corresponding names and geo locations
- An empty database, with pre defined schemas for storing the live IoT traffic and sensor data
* Access to the Red Hat API Designer tool for exploring the OpenAPI Spec compatible API definition
* Implementation of the API Server Node.js which will have the API definition implemented and connectivity to Postgres pre-configured
* Access to 3scale API Management service for protecting your API
* An implementation of the front end web app with a API calls implemented

{blank}

The architecture diagram below provides an overview of the complete solution. Data is flowing from the right to left in the diagram.

== API Definition using Red Hat API Designer

Red Hat API Designer is a tool that provides the ability to create *OpenAPI Specification* compatible API definitions.
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
For more information on the *OpenAPI Specification* see the link:{oas3-url}[Open API Specification, window="_blank"] on GitHub

In this section we will use the Red Hat API designer to explore a pre-built an OpenAPI Specification which is used in the implementation of our API Server.
The APIs created will combine data from the provided Lookup Tables in Postgres - *{postgres-junction-lookup-table}* and *{postgres-meter-lookup-table}* - with the data from the live junction and meter tables which is being ingested from AMQ Streams.

=== Viewing an Open API Spec

. Download the ZIP file containing the OpenAPI Spec from link:https://gist.github.com/evanshortiss/b658a32c4145e59525f90bbbec68db4a/archive/f0057efb472253b382b5a9a9150924359c558302.zip[this link].
. Unzip the file and open the resulting folder. It should contain a JSON file that holds that OpenAPI Spec data.
. Open the link:{apicurio-url}[Red Hat API Designer Dashboard, window="_blank"] and click the *OpenAPI* button.
. When prompted to choose a file select the JSON file you just unzipped.

[type=verification]
Did the Red Hat API Designer UI render the OpenAPI Spec using the file you uploaded?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you selected the correct JSON file. If the OpenAPI Spec fails to render in Red Hat API Designer please contact the lab administrator.

=== View API Data Types

This API contains two primary data types, the *Junction* and *Meter*. Here's how you can view their properties using Red Hat API Designer.

. On the left-hand side of the Red Hat API Designer UI you should see a *Data Types* section after the OpenAPI Spec JSON was loaded.
. Choose the *Junction* item under the *Data Types* heading. Information and properties of a *Junction* are now displayed on the right of the Red Hat API Designer UI.
. Select the *Source* tab at the top of the right-hand pane to view the data that represents a *Junction* type in this OpenAPI Spec.
. Click the *As JSON* button on the right to toggle between JSON and YAML representations of the OpenAPI spec.
. Choose the *Meter* item under the *Data Types* heading.
. Note that the *Meter* has fewer properties than the *Junction*, but it utilises an *Enum* type to specify valid states that a Meter can be in.

=== API Paths

. Lastly, click each of four entries listed under the *Paths* heading and note that each path only supports *GET* requests since this going to be a readonly API.
. Two of the endpoints support a path parameter as denoted by the placeholder brackets - `{}`, for example `/meters/32` would return information for a meter with the ID of `32`.
. Note that the `/meters` meters endpoint supports a query parameter named `status` that can be set to one of four values defined by an *Enum* type.

{blank}

Once you're happy that you understand the API endpoints and parameters continue to the next section.

== Data Ingestion from AMQ Streams to Postgres using Fuse Online

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, such as AMQ Streams and Postgres.
In this section we will create two *Connections* - one to AMQ Streams and one to Postgres.
We will then create an *Integration* that uses these two connections and translates the incoming data from AMQ Streams into database *INSERT* statements on Postgres.

=== Creating the AMQ Streams Connector

In this step you will create a *Connection* that will enable your *Integration* to connect to a pre-existing AMQ Streams Broker.

== Deployment of the API Implementation
In this section you'll deploy a pre-built implementation of the OpenAPI Specification you explored previously.

=== Connecting to Postgres

When deploying API server implementation, you will need to use the following details to connect your API Server to your Postgres DB:

. Username: `{postgres-username}`
. Password: `{postgres-password}`
. Hostname: `{postgres-hostname}`
. Database: `{postgres-database}`
. Port: `{postgres-port}`

{blank}

The *username* and *password* information will be provided to your API server via a *Secret* that you will create in the OpenShift UI.

=== Create a DeploymentConfig

A *DeploymentConfig* is an OpenShift API Object that defines the state and deployment environment of an application. This includes, but isn't limited to the number of instances (known as *Pods*) and environment variables.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Choose *Home > Projects* from the side menu and select *{walkthrough-namespace}* from the list. This will display the *Project Details* screen.
+
NOTE: You can pin the project to the top of the Project select list for easier future selection using the plus icon beside its name.
. Select the *Workloads* tab from the *Project Details* screen.
. Select *add other content* from the *Workloads* screen.
. Choose the *Container Image* option from the *Add* screen.
. On the *Deploy Image* screen enter the following:
.. For *Image Name* enter `quay.io/evanshortiss/summit-2020-rhmi-lab-nodejs-backend` and click the search icon to display the container image details.
.. Leave the *Name* and *Application Name* fields at their default values.
.. Select *DeploymentConfig* under the *Resources* section.
.. Leave the *Create a route to the application* box checked under the *Advanced Options* section.
. Finally, click *Create* to deploy the container image.

{blank}

At this point you've successfully created a *DeploymentConfig* for your application, but the application is unable to start successfully. This is because it needs to be provided the credentials to connect to the City Postgres database - we'll tackle that in the next section.

=== Create a Secret

Secrets can be used to store sensitive information securely such that it's not visible in plaintext when interacting with the OpenShift Cluster. The following steps will have you create a Secret to store the database connection details.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Choose *Home > Projects* from the side menu and select your *{walkthrough-namespace}* from the list. This will display the *Project Details* screen.
. Choose *Workloads > Secrets* on the left and click the *Create > Key/Value Secret* button on the *Secrets* screen.
. Enter `pg-secrets` in the *Secret Name* field.
. Create a key named `username` with a value of `{postgres-username}` in the text box below the *Browse* option.
. Click *Add Key/Value* to create another key/value pair.
. Enter the key name of `password` with a value of `{postgres-password}`.
. Click *Create*.

[type=verification]
Is the Secret listed under *Workloads > Secrets*, and if you view it are the *username* and *password* values obscured in the OpenShift UI?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you're in the correct section of the OpenShift UI and followed the directions. If the Secret cannot be created or viewed please talk to your lab administrator.

=== Update the DeploymentConfig with the Postgres Secret

Now that you've created a *Secret* containing the database connection information it's time to put it to use.

The key/value pairs stored in the *Secret* can be associated with the *DeploymentConfig*, and exposed to the underlying application as *Environment Variables*.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Choose *Workloads > DeploymentConfigs* from the side menu and verify the selected Project is set to *{walkthrough-namespace}* using the dropdown.
. Select the *{dc-name}* item in the list. The *Deployment Config Details* screen is displayed.
. Select *Environment* tab and click *Add from ConfigMap or Secret*.
. In the new row, `PG_USERNAME` in the *name* field and select the *pg-secrets* resource and *username* key.
. Click *Add from ConfigMap or Secret* again.
. In the new row, `PG_PASSWORD` in the *name* field and select the *pg-secrets* resource and *password* key.
. Click the *Save* button.

{blank}

This will cause a redeployment of the application *Pods*. You can verify this from *Workloads > Pods*. We didn't need to provide a database hostname since the deployed application is pre-configured with that information.

=== Verify the Deployment

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Choose *Workloads > Pods* and verify the selected Project is set to *{walkthrough-namespace}* using the dropdown.
. You should see a *Pod* named *{dc-name}* followed by a number and unique ID in the list, e.g *{dc-name}-2-ab21d*. The *Status* column for this Pod should state that it's *Running*.
. Choose *Networking > Routes* from the side menu and verify the selected Project is set to *{walkthrough-namespace}* using the dropdown.
. A route named *{dc-name}* should be listed in a table.
. Click the URL listed under the *Location* to view the Swagger UI docs for your deployed Node.js API.
. From the Swagger UI displayed in your browser expand the */meters* and click the *Try it out* button.
. Optionally, choose a value from the *status* dropdown.
. Click the blue *Execute* button to make a request to the API and verify that a JSON response is shown in the *Server response* section of the Swagger UI.

{blank}

You should see a JSON response similar to the sample below:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
[
  {
    "status_text": "available",
    "latitude": 34.0509,
    "address": "301 S HILL ST",
    "longitude": -118.25,
    "meter_id": 1074,
    "last_updated": "2020-03-20T21:40:12.000Z"
  },
  {
    "status_text": "available",
    "latitude": 34.0623,
    "address": "10801 W WEYBURN AVE",
    "longitude": -118.443,
    "meter_id": 455,
    "last_updated": "2020-03-20T21:38:42.000Z"
  }
]
----

[type=verification]
Are you able to execute queries and see JSON results in Swagger UI?

[type=verificationFail]

Verify that the *Pod* you checked as part of *Verify the Deployment* is in a *Running* state. If the URL does not display a Swagger UI or the *Server response* is not in the correct JSON format please contact the lab administrator.

[time=25]
== API Protection using 3scale API Management

In order to secure and expose the traffic and parking meter service that was built in the previous section, we will be performing the following activities in Red Hat 3scale API Management:

* Creating a new Product and Backend
* Creating an Application Plan
* Creating an Application
* Configuring the API Settings

{blank}

Here's a quick overview of these terms:

* A *Product* defines the developer/consumer facing end service you wish to make available for consumption.
* A *Backend* defines the backend service(s) you wish to protect and make available via a *Product*.
* An *Applications* define the credentials (e.g. API Key) to access your API. Applications are stored within *Developer Accounts*.
* An *Application Plan* determines the access policies and is always associated with one *Application*.


=== API Management Login

. Open the link:{3scale-management-url}[3scale Login screen, window="_blank"] and log in with your username and password. 
. The main Dashboard should be displayed.

{blank}

[type=verification]
Can you see the {3Scale-ProductName} Dashboard and navigate the main menu?

----
http://summit-2020-rhmi-lab-nodejs-backend.{walkthrough-namespace}.svc.cluster.local:8080
----
{blank}
+
NOTE: This is a private URL that is not accessible on public networks. Only other services running on the OpenShift Clutser can access it. You can see that it's name is derived from the *Service* created under *Networking > Services* in your project and the name of the *Project* itself. It also uses port 8080 since this is the port the container exposes the API on.
. Click *Create Backend*.
. Verify that *Backend: {3scale-backend-name}* is selected in the top navigation menu of {3Scale-ProductName}.
. Select *Mapping Rules* from the side navigation.
. Click *Add Mapping Rule* on the *Mapping Rules* screen to create a mapping rule:

. The *Environments* section in *Integration > Configuration* should now contain the *Staging Environment* details.
. Use the *Example curl for testing* to retrieve available meters via cURL or your preferred HTTP client, e.g:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
curl "{3scale-staging-api-host}/meters?status=available&user_key=YOUR_KEY_HERE"
----

[type=verification]
Were you able to query the API via {3Scale-ProductName} and retrieve a list of available meters?

[type=verificationFail]
Ensure that the API Key (`user_key`) is defined in the sample Staging cURL command and that you entered the correct URL in the Backend configuration. Contact the lab administrator if the issue persists.

== Frontend visualisation using React and Patternfly 4

In this section you will deploy a web UI that displays the latest parking meter and junction traffic information by retrieving it from the {3Scale-ProductName} API. The UI is created using PatternFly, an open source design system created to enable consistency and usability across a wide range of applications and use cases.

Deployment of the UI requires customisation to account for your specific {3Scale-ProductName} API Key and Staging URL. This means you'll be creating a *Build Config* that will use the source-to-image (s2i) strategy to create a container image via a *Build* - your API Key and Staging URL will be injected into the *Build*.

Once the UI is deployed it will provide two primary pages; Parking Meters and Traffic Junctions.

The Parking Meters page will:

. Display a Google Map
. Render a map marker for each meter
. Cluster the meters when the map is zoomed out
. Support filters for each meter state, e.g show only "available" parking meters

{empty} +

The Traffic Junctions page will:

. Display a Google Map
. Use Heatmap functionality from Google Maps to render traffic conditions

{empty} +

=== Create a Build from Git

The frontend code is stored in a Git repository. In this section you'll create a s2i (source-to-image) *Build* that will turn that code into a container image. It will also create the necessary OpenShift API Objects such as *Image Streams*, a *Build Config* and *DeploymentConfig* for you.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Select the *Developer* view using the dropdown underneath the Red Hat OpenShift logo.
. Select the *{walkthrough-namespace}* from the *Project* dropdown to the right of where you chose the developer view.
. From the left-side menu select *Add*.
. In the main content area a list of options should be presented. Choose the *From Git* option.
. An *Import from Git* wizard is displayed. Enter the following in *Git Repo URL*: `https://github.com/evanshortiss/rhmi-enablement-2020-lab`.
. Expand the *Advanced Git Options* section and enter `/solutions/traffic-application-frontend` in the *Context Dir*.
. The *Node.js* option under *Builder Image* should been selected automatically, but if it's not select it now.
. Select verion 10 under the *Builder Image Version* dropdown.
. In the *General* section:
.. Click the *Application* dropdown and select `Create Application`.
.. Enter `{is-name}-app` for *Application Name* and `{is-name}` for *Name*.
. Select *DeploymentConfig* under the *Resources* section.
. Ensure that *Create a route to the application* is checked.
. Click the *Build Configuration* link and create the following *Environment Variables*:
.. `API_URL` with the value of your 3scale Staging API URL.
.. `API_KEY` with the value of your 3scale Staging API Key.
.. `MAPS_API_KEY` with a value provided by the lab administrator, or your own Google Maps API Key.
. Click the *Routing* link:
.. Leave *Hostname* and *Path* at the default values.
.. Set *Target Port*  `8080`.
.. Ensure *Secure Route* is checked.
.. Set *TLS Termination* to `Edge`.
.. Set *Insecure Traffic* to `Redirect`.
. Scroll down and click *Create*.

=== Monitor the Build

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. The view defaults to *Administrator* mode. Toggle the *Developer* view using the dropdown underneath the Red Hat OpenShift logo.
. Select the *{walkthrough-namespace}* from the *Project* dropdown to the right of where you chose the developer view.
. Choose *Builds* on the left menu.
. Select the *traffic-frontend* build and navigate to the *Builds* tab.
. Select the *traffic-frontend-1* build and then the *Logs* tab.

[type=verification]
Do the logs show a successful git clone and eventually end with `Push successful` message? If you select the *Topology* view from the side menu is the `traffic-frontend` Node.js application listed? If you click the `traffic-frontend` a panel appears on the right - does the panel display a *Pod* with status set to *Running*?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you set the *Environment Variables* and *Git* settings for the *Build* correctly, and start the build again. Contact the administrator if the issue persists.

=== Using the Application

Now that the *Build* is complete it's time to see everything working together.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Select the *Developer* view using the dropdown underneath the Red Hat OpenShift logo.
. Select the *{walkthrough-namespace}* from the *Project* dropdown to the right of where you chose the developer view.
. Choose the *Topology* view on from the left-side menu and click the *traffic-frontend* item.
. In the pane on the right click the URL under the *Routes* section.
. Take a look at the *Traffic Map* and *Parking Map* pages to see live traffic and parking meter status information displayed on a map.

[type=verification]
Is the *Traffic Heatmap* page displayed? It should be showing a map with clusters showing traffic hot spots.

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that the *{is-name}* application *Pod* is in a *Running* state. If the map loads but no heatmap is overlaid then verify that the *{dc-name}* application *Pod* is in a *Running* state. Ask your lab administrator for assistance if necessary.

=== Using the Application

Now it's time to see everything come together.

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Select *Home > Projects* from the side menu and select *{walkthrough-namespace}* from the list. This will display the *Project Details* screen.
. To view the application UI, select *Networking > Routes* and click the URL in the *Location* column for the *{is-name}* item.
. Take a look at the *Traffic Map* and *Parking Map* pages to see live traffic and parking meter status information displayed on a map.

[type=verification]
Is the *Traffic Heatmap* page displayed? It should be showing a map with clusters showing traffic hot spots.

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that the *{is-name}* application *Pod* is in a *Running* state. If the map loads but no heatmap is overlaid then verify that the *{dc-name}* application *Pod* is in a *Running* state. Ask your lab administrator for assistance if necessary.
